        Understands the arguments for and against SSR vs. CSR
    </h2>
    <h4>SSR and CSR are to different ways of rendering web pages. </h4>
    <p> SSR is a slower than CSR, because the server must generate the HTML and CSS before sending it to the client. But
        when the page is loaded, then the page is faster because you only need to load the new changes on the
        website. </p>
    <p>CSR is faster because the server sends the client minimal HTML and JavaScript, and here the browser handles the
        rendering instead of the server. But if you have a lot of data, then CSR will be slow. </p>
    <p>Client side rendering is a way to inject HTML and CSS on the client browser. In that way it takes more time and
        take more resources for the client. Why is that a problem? It is a problem because with the time issue and the
        other problem is SEO, because in CSR they only pull the HTML pages and not the script. Here google see just a
        plank page. </p>
    <p>In SSR the server require more resources, but that doesn't affect the client, and the client is the most
        important for making money. For SEO SSR is a better solution because it receives a complete HTML document that
        includes all the pages content. The reason for that is SSR â€“ the HTML is rendered on the server before it is
        sent to the client. Therefore, the search engine crawlers can easily index the pages the HTML pages. </p>

    <p>Nodemon.ext is way a tool which that automatically restarts your Node.js application when changes are detected.
        In our case we did it with js, json and html. The way you set it up is to create a nodemon.json file and write
        this:</p>
