<div class="scoping">
    <h2>Understand scoping in Javascript and know to always use const if you can get away with it otherwise let.</h2>
    <p>Scoping in JavaScript refers to the accessibility of the variables. It is bad practice to use var and in ES6
        const and let was introduce to take over. Var is accessible in the whole function while const and let are
        accessible in the block of code where they are
        declared. Const maintain the constant value, while let is a value that can change. </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot" src="../../assets/images/scoping1.png"></div>
    <p> Here we have to functions where the var is declared as I. The problem with that is I is accessible in the entire
        function, so the result of the first function will give 6,6,6,6,6,6. The right way to solve this problem is to
        use let instead. Let has block scope which means it is only accessible where it is declared. </p>

<div class="packagejson">
    <h2>Understands Package.json and can set it up by hand.</h2>
    <p>Package.json is a file in node.js that contains the meta information, dependencies and scripts. The dependencies
        are the key in package.json because they defined all the dependecies in the project, for example express and
        nodemon. </p>
    <p>They way you set the package.json up is going(cd change directory) to the folder where you want the file. Open
        the terminal and enter the command: </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot1" src="../../assets/images/npm1.png"></div>
    <p>Npm init â€“y will automatically create a new package.json file with default values. </p>
    <p>After the package.json file is created then you can download express and nodemon with two commands </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot2" src="../../assets/images/npm2.png"></div>
    <div><img id="screenshot3" src="../../assets/images/npm3.png"></div>
    <p>Now you have package.json with the dependecies:</p>
    <div><img id="screenshot4" src="../../assets/images/npm4.png"></div>
    <p>You can also set up in manually by going to the folder where you want you package.json file. Then you can in the
        terminal create a command where you create an empty package.json file: "touch package.json". After that you can
        manually write the dependencies by writing the key "express" and then the version "4.18.2"
        After that you need to write a command in the terminal to install the depdencies which is:
        npm install </p>
</div>

<div class="expressServer">
    <h2>Express server</h2>
    <div><img id="screenshot5" src="../../assets/images/express.png"></div>
    <p>
        This is an example of how you create a server instance with express. The first thing you have to do it to import
        express and you do that with "require". After that you need to initialze an instance of the express framework.
        Now we the object app that returns express and that means we can built our server and put it up running. In this
        example we are running the server on port 8080 with the app.listen method. </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot6" src="../../assets/images/express2.png"></div>
    <p>This example is similar to the another one beside the first line of code. Here I have used modules to do that. In
        my package.json I have "type": "module" and that allows us to use import instead of require. This is also
        called ECMA script. ECMAscript is mainly used for our server-side code.</p>

<div class="getrequest">
    <h2>Understands how to send data with GET requests over HTTP</h2>
    <p> To send data with get request then we have to use query parameters and. Query parameters have to append at the
        end of the URL with a question mark.
        Here is an example of how to do that in express: </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot7" src="../../assets/images/get.png"></div>
    <div><img id="screenshot8" src="../../assets/images/get1.png"></div>
</div>

<div class="nodemodules">
    <h2>Understand node.modules</h2>
    <p>Node modules is a folder that stores and managed all the dependencies. When we use the command npm install to
        install a dependecy then the node.modules get created automatically and in node.module each depedeency get its
        own package, so when we run our application with nodemon og node then it looks in the node.modules folder.</p>
</div>

<div class="staticfiles">
    <h2>Understands the security need for serving static files</h2>
    <p>Serving static files tells the clients is allowed to use the files in the public folder. We are preventing them
        to get access to our server. It secures and tells that the clients is allowed to use the files in the public
        folder - it shouldnt get acess at my database and server.</p>
