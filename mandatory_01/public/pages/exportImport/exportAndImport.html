    <p>You can use export on certain function or variables which makes the functions or variables available for other
        parts of the code. You use the import to get access to the bring the functions or variables into another module.

    <h2>Can import/export in both ways in Node.js</h2>
    <p>
        In node.js you can import/export in 2 ways. There is require which is commonJs and there is import which is type
        modules(ECMAscript). The commonJs modules are loaded synchronously while type modules are loaded asynchronously.

        CommonJs is the standard in node.js but if you want type modules then you have to insert it in the package.json
        file:

    <div><img id="screenshot2" src="../../assets/images/import2.png"></div>
</div>

<div class="xss">
    <h2>XSS: Understands the problem and how to avoid it.</h2>
    <p>XSS or Cross-Site-Scripting is a security problem that we have in the browser. When we use innerHtml then any
        string is treated by html code and for that reason the attack can insert some dangerous code that could lead to
        XSS attack. That is why we use innerText instead. </p>
