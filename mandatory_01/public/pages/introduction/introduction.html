<div class="git-commands">
    <h2>Work with Git in the Terminal</h2>
    <p>If you want to clone a project then you have to use the command:</p>
    <pre>git clone gitlink</pre>
    <p>If you want to convert it into a repository then you need to use the command:</p>
    <pre>git init</pre>
    <p>If you want to add a remote to your repository then you can use the command:</p>
    <p>The remote tells Git where to pull and push from, and it is tied to the specific folder on your computer.</p>
    <pre><code>git remote add origin path</code></pre>
    <p>If you want to add to the project then you need to use the command:</p>
    <p>The <code>-A</code> is all files.</p>
    <pre><code>git add -A</code></pre>
    <p>Then you have to use the command.</p>
    <p>The <code>-m</code> allows you to write a commit message.</p>
    <pre><code>git commit -m "commit message"</code></pre>
    <p>If you want to push then you can use the command:</p>
    <pre><code>git push</code></pre>

<div class="datatypes">
    <h2>Datatypes in javascript:</h2>
    <h2>Javascript has several data types which are primitive or non-primitive.</h2>
    <ul>
        Number: it is a value and it can be with commas so a number can be 3 or 3.40.
        <br>
        String: Textual data where you wrap it around double or single quote, "Hello World".
        <br>
        Boolean: a logical value that returns true or false.
        <br>
        Null: Which returns a null value.
        <br>
        Undefined: A undefined datatype is a type that is uninitialized or is undefined
    </ul>

    <h2>Then we also have three non-primitive types: </h2>

    <ul>

        Object: An object is a collection of data where you wrap it around brackets {}
        <br>


        Array: Array is an orded list where you can store som values in that list. You write arrays in square
        brackets[].

        <br>

        Function: A function is reusable code that does something specific.

        <br>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="node">
    <h2>Explain node and how to run files</h2>
    <p>Node is an open-source back-end JavaScript runtime environment. This means that you can run JavaScript code
        outside of the web-browser. Node is used for server-side web-applications, which means that the code gets
        executed on a server instead rather than on the client. </p>

</div>

<div class="restapi">
    <h2>
        REST API design
    </h2>
    <div><img id="screenshot" src="../../assets/images/api.png"></div>

    <p>This is how screenshot of how you could design your REST API.
        First you have to define the HTTP method and after that you have to define the endpoints. It is important to use
        nouns when you define your endpoints. </p>

</div>

<div class="cleancode">
    <h2>Clean code and good conventions</h2>
    <p>Following good code conventions makes the code cleaner and that essential for high-quality code. It is always
        good to follow the standard code conventions when you write code. That could be make packages for your files and
        divide the project in components and have good and understandable name for your files and etc.. For example we
        named our node file as "app.js" because that is the standard and by naming the files after the standard in the
        "real world", then it makes it easier to read and understand the code. </p>
</div>

<div class="callback">
    <h2>Callback function</h2>
    <p>A callback function is passed as arguments that you call back. </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot1" src="../../assets/images/callback.png"></div>
    <p>Here is two example of callback functions with a normal function and arrow function. </p>

</div>

<div class="loop">
    <h2>Loop methods in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Map allows you to transform the values in the array and then it returns a new array.</p>
    <div><img id="screenshot2" src="../../assets/images/map.png"></div>
    <p>Here is an example of how map works. I am creating a spread operator, and it takes all the key values and spreads
        it into a new object. Then I put it into a new object to avoid side effects. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The filter method creates a new array filled with the elements that pass a test provided by a function. </p>
    <div><img id="screenshot3" src="../../assets/images/filter.png"></div>
    <p>Here I create a filter method where I am trying to filter all the rocks beside the age of %2 and then it gives a
        new array with the new elements. </p>

    <h2>Understands why a functional approach to loops is to be preferred</h2>
    <p>The reason why we use functional approach is because methods like map and filter is to transform data instead of
        just looping through the data. The methods takes and function as an argument where the function is aplied to
        each element in the data, and then it returns a new array with that data </p>
