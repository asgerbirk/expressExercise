<div class="redirect">
    <h2>Understands the difference between client-side redirection and server-side. </h2>

    <p>
        In client side redirection the browser redirect the user to a new URL, without having any contact with the
        server. With that you can use "Window.location.href = "URL". In server side redirection the redirection is
        happening on the server side, which makes it more reliable and we can use the "res.redirect".

    <h2>
        Can argue for a better way to structure the frontend (assets, pages) and how to structure HTML.
    </h2>
    <p>
        It makes the code of the page easier to read and maintain, as the purpose of each section of the page is clearly
        defined and therefore we follow good code conventions. It can improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of
        the page, as search engines can use the HTML structure to better understand the content of the page. It is also
        good to create folders and packages to separate different files so when people look into our code, they know
        where to find things.
